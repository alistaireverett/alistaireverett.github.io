I am a **research scientist** studying **ice-ocean interactions** at **marine-terminating glaciers**. 

I use a combination of **modelling**, **remote sensing** and whatever **field data** I can get my hands on to improve our understanding of feedbacks between **glaciers** and **oceans**. 

**Modelling** is carried out using a combination of **high-resolution fluid dynamics code**, simplified **1D modelling** and **analytical solutions**. I primarily write code in **Python**, but I also have experience in **Fortran, Matlab and C++**, amongst others. I have experience compiling and running these codes in **parallel** on **national HPC systems** in the UK and Norway. 

**Field data** analysis includes experience in processing **conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD) data** from boat-based CTD devices and **seals** instrumented with GPS-CTD devices. I also have experience processing **remote sensing data** including **Landsat**, **MODIS**, and **WorldView imagery**; **airborne LiDAR** and **digital elevation models**. 

I have **field experience** in **Greenland**, **Svalbard** and **Alaska**, and I was the **scientific leader** on the **British Stauning Alps, East Greenland, Expedition** in 2017. 

In my spare time I am a keen **trail runner**, **mountaineer**, **climber** and quickly adding **skiing** to the list.
