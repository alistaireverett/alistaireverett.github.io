Most of my research focuses on the ice-ocean interface at the terminus of large glaciers around the coastline of Greenland and Svalbard. Sometimes this extends a few kilometers up-glacier to look at meltwater behaviour near the glacier terminus, and sometimes a little way out into the fjord to look at ocean circulation near the terminus. A lot of my work is based on high-resolution finite element modelling of [buoyant plumes of subglacial discharge](https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/cr/2016/10/28/image-of-the-week-plumes-of-water-melting-greenlands-tidewater-glaciers/){:target="_blank"}, you can find some videos of this work [here](https://alistaireverett.github.io/plume_videos/).
