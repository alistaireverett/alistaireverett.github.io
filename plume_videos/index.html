<h1>Plume model videos</h1>

<p>
Here a some example videos produced with a high-resolution plume model set up using <a href="http://fluidityproject.github.io/">Fluidity</a>. 

Visualisation produced using <a href="https://www.paraview.org/">Paraview</a>.

<h3><a href="https://alistaireverett.github.io/plume_videos/plume_density.mp4">Simple Plume Density Animation</a></h3> 

<p>A simple view through a plume designed to resemble laboratory experiments. 

The rendering is created from a 3D model using volume transparency, where darker blue is lower density.</p>


<h3><a href="https://alistaireverett.github.io/plume_videos/plume_melt_3D.mp4">3D with vertical glacier face.</a></h3> 

<p>Model setup with a vertical glacier wall on the left side. Melt is plot white (low) -> red (high), and density as above blue (low) - transparent (high). </p>


<h3><a href="https://alistaireverett.github.io/plume_videos/line_plume_moving_mesh.mp4">Line release with moving mesh test</a></h3> 

<p>A test case for the time evolving mesh implementation with a uniformly distributed release of subglacial discharge along the base of the glacier terminus.</p>
