Here a some example videos produced with a high-resolution plume model set up using [Fluidity](http://fluidityproject.github.io/).

Visualisation produced using [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/){:target="_blank"}

## [Simple Plume Density Animation](https://alistaireverett.github.io/plume_videos/plume_density.mp4){:target="_blank"}

A simple view through a plume designed to resemble laboratory experiments. 

The rendering is created from a 3D model using volume transparency, where darker blue is lower density.


## [3D with vertical glacier face](https://alistaireverett.github.io/plume_videos/plume_melt_3D.mp4){:target="_blank"}

Model setup with a vertical glacier wall on the left side. Melt is plot white (low) -> red (high), and density as above blue (low) - transparent (high).


## [Line release with moving mesh test](https://alistaireverett.github.io/plume_videos/line_plume_moving_mesh.mp4){:target="_blank"}

A test case for the time evolving mesh implementation with a uniformly distributed release of subglacial discharge along the base of the glacier terminus.
