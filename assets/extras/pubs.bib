  abstract  = {Supraglacial lake drainage events are common on the Greenland ice sheet. Observations on the west coast typically show an up‐glacier progression of drainage as the annual melt extent spreads inland. We use a suite of remote sensing and modeling techniques in order to study a series of lakes and water‐filled crevasses within 20 km of the terminus of Helheim Glacier, southeast Greenland. Automatic classification of surface water areas shows a down‐glacier progression of drainage, which occurs in the majority of years between 2007 and 2014. We demonstrate that a linear elastic fracture mechanics model can reliably predict the drainage of the uppermost supraglacial lake in the system but cannot explain the pattern of filling and draining observed in areas of surface water downstream. We propose that the water levels in crevasses downstream of the supraglacial lake can be explained by a transient high‐pressure wave passing through the subglacial system following the lake drainage. We support this hypothesis with analysis of the subglacial hydrological conditions, which can explain both the position and interannual variation in filling order of these crevasses. Similar behavior has been observed in association with jökulhaups, surging glaciers, and Antarctic subglacial lakes but has not previously been observed on major outlets of the Greenland ice sheet. Our results suggest that the behavior of near‐terminus surface water may differ considerably from that of inland supraglacial lakes, with the potential for basal water pressures to influence the presence of surface water in crevasses close to the terminus of tidewater glaciers.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we study the effects of basal friction, sub-aqueous undercutting and glacier geometry on the calving process by combining six different models in an offline-coupled workflow: a continuum–mechanical ice flow model (Elmer/Ice), a climatic mass balance model, a simple subglacial hydrology model, a plume model, an undercutting model and a discrete particle model to investigate fracture dynamics (Helsinki Discrete Element Model, HiDEM). We demonstrate the feasibility of reproducing the observed calving retreat at the front of Kronebreen, a tidewater glacier in Svalbard, during a melt season by using the output from the first five models as input to HiDEM. Basal sliding and glacier motion are addressed using Elmer/Ice, while calving is modelled by HiDEM. A hydrology model calculates subglacial drainage paths and indicates two main outlets with different discharges. Depending on the discharge, the plume model computes frontal melt rates, which are iteratively projected to the actual front of the glacier at subglacial discharge locations. This produces undercutting of different sizes, as melt is concentrated close to the surface for high discharge and is more diffuse for low discharge. By testing different configurations, we show that undercutting plays a key role in glacier retreat and is necessary to reproduce observed retreat in the vicinity of the discharge locations during the melting season. Calving rates are also influenced by basal friction, through its effects on near-terminus strain rates and ice velocity.},

  abstract  = {Many researchers have analysed the effect of wind on fjord dynamics by using two-dimensional numerical models. This paper investigates the wind and tidal forcing effects on the strong stratification and circulation by application of the three-dimensional model TELEMAC-3D. The capability of the model to reproduce the physical processes has been investigated by applying it to Sermilik Fjord, Greenland. This study shows that the major changes in the fjord dynamics are wind induced. Any changes in the wind speed have an instant impact on the water surface velocities. Also, the diffusively driven circulation produced by the horizontal pressure gradients at coast plays an important role in fjord dynamics. After calibration, the tidal model produced matching results with the measured wave height. The tidal analysis shows that the strength and direction of the tidal currents are sensitive to any changes in the width and shape of the domain. The effect of the tidal propagation on the salinity profile has been shown to play an important role, with salinity picks being 5–6 h behind the tidal flood and ebb picks, along the wind forcing, on the fjord circulation. TELEMAC-3D is a suitable model to simulate accurately such complicated dynamics as in presented case study.},
